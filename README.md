# Suprise Housing: House price prediction
> The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set related to various housing properties from the actual sale of houses in Australia.

## General Information
- This case study is to apply Machine Learning technique to solve the business problem of Suprise Housing  to predict house price. Solving this assignment will give an idea about how linear Regression is used in real business problems.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
* Which variables are significant to predict the price of a house
* And how well those variables describe the price of a house

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Steps involved
* Reading and Understanding the Data
* Data cleaning
* Data visualization
* Data preparation
* Train-Test splitting
* Model Building and Evaluation
* Residual Analysis

## Conclusions
* top 5 positive relation variable influencing sales price: GrLivArea, GarageCars, FireplaceQu, BedroomAbvGr and FullBath 
* top 5 negative relation variable Sales price: MSZoning_RM, BldgType_Twnh, Exterior1st_Stucco, Age of property,MSSubClass and some Neighborhood influence the sales price negatively
* The residual analysis for both test and train data seem to fit the assumptions of the Linear Regression.
* Clearly we see how lasso and ridge regression could boost the feature selection process for regression problems.
